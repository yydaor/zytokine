        Pierce: pierces; ignores target hit rules 
        Fork: forks on contact creating N extra projectiles

Activation -
    Direct: uses SKILL PRESS on key press
    Hold: uses SKILL DOWN on key down
    Hold -> Release: uses SKILL PRESS on key press, uses SKILL DOWN on key down, uses SKILL RELEASE on key release
    Toggle: toggles SKILL USE on key press
    Passive: always on

Combinations -
Area, Projectile, Self: submethod.
Area-Projectile: area applied on contact with Solid or Enemy.
Area-Self: area applied with self as POINT.
Projectile-Self: only when possible (orbit) 
Area-Projectile-Self: area applied with projectile's position as POINT.

An attack needs to have an Activation method AND at least one of Area, Projectile or Self (APS) methods.
APS methods can be combined in specific ways given the submethods chosen (Types, Movement and Modifiers)
and most of the time should work well with each other. Some submethods, though, may disable another APS submethod
or method entirely. For instance, taking the Projectile-Self combination will disable most submethods for both
methods, considering that it only makes sense to have the [Orbit] Projectile movement submethod work with the
Self method (since the player will be the chosen Point). On the other hand, taking the Projectile-Area combination
will work for most submethods since the combination applies the area on projectile contact with an enemy or solid.
